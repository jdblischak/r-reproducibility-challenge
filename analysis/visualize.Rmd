Import the mice weights.

```{r import-data}
weights <- read.delim("../data/weights.txt",
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(weights)
```

Density plots

```{r density-plots}
plot(density(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Wild type"]), xlim = c(15, 30))
lines(density(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Transgenic"]), col = "red")
```

QQ plots

```{r qq-plots}
qqnorm(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Wild type"], main = "Wild type")
qqline(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Wild type"])
qqnorm(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Transgenic"], main = "Transgenic")
qqline(weights$grams[weights$mouse == "Transgenic"])
```

**Conclusion:** the weights of the wild type mice appear normally distributed,
but the weights of the transgenic mice deviate from the normal distribution.
