Import the mice weights.

```{r import-data}
weights <- read.delim("../data/weights.txt",
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(weights)
```

Test for a difference in weight between the wild type and transgenic mice using
a t-test:

```{r t-test}
result <- t.test(grams ~ mouse, data = weights)
result
```

The p-value is `r result$p.value`.
